In that problem, the salesman starts at a random city and repeatedly visits the nearest city until all have been visited. The algorithm quickly yields a short tour, but usually not the optimal one."

    "## Note\n",
    "\n",
    "The nearest neighbour algorithm is easy to implement and executes quickly, but it can sometimes miss shorter routes which are easily noticed with human insight, due to its \"greedy\" nature. As a general guide, if the last few stages of the route are comparable in length to the first stages, then the route is reasonable; if they are much greater, then it is likely that much better routes exist. Another check is to use an algorithm such as the lower bound algorithm to estimate if this route is good enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the worst case, the algorithm results in a route that is much longer than the optimal route. To be precise, for every constant r there is an instance of the traveling salesman problem such that the length of the route computed by the nearest neighbour algorithm is greater than r times the length of the optimal route. Moreover, for each number of cities there is an assignment of distances between the cities for which the nearest neighbor heuristic produces the unique worst possible route. (If the algorithm is applied on every vertex as the starting vertex, the best path found will be better than at least N/2-1 other routes, where N is the number of vertices.)\n",
    "\n",
