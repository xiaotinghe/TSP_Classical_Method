    "In optimization, 2-opt is a simple local search algorithm for solving the traveling salesman problem. The 2-opt algorithm was first proposed by Croes in 1958, although the basic move had already been suggested by Flood. The main idea behind it is to take a route that crosses over itself and reorder it so that it does not."
